#!/bin/bash
# This simple wrapper allowing us to pass a set of
# environment variables to be sourced prior to running
# another command. Used in the launch file for setting
# robot configurations prior to xacro.

# To catch the first argument in a variable
# If I call this script as env_run test
# Then ENVVARS_FILE has the value of 'test'
ENVVARS_FILE=$1
# Shift makes my first argument become a new position. Depending on how much I shifted
# If I shift 1, then my first argument will now be the second ($2)
shift 1

# Helps to export env variables so I can used them in terminal and in my script
set -a
# Updates my variable value to the one assigned here 
source $ENVVARS_FILE 
# Lists positional parameters specified in script invocation 
# env_run test test1 test2
# Gives me 'test' 'test1' 'test2'
$@
